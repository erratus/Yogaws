                        <p>Hatha Yoga is one of the oldest forms of yoga, with its roots going back to the 15th century. The practice was codified in the "Hatha Yoga Pradipika," a Sanskrit manual written by the sage Yogi Swatmarama. Hatha Yoga encompasses a broad set of physical postures (asanas), breath control techniques (pranayama), and meditation aimed at purifying and balancing the mind and body.</p>
                        <p>This style of yoga is often recommended for beginners due to its slower pace and focus on breathwork. The benefits of Hatha Yoga include increased flexibility, enhanced strength, reduced stress, and improved mental clarity. It lays a foundation for other, more advanced yoga practices.</p>

                        <p>Iyengar Yoga, developed by B.K.S. Iyengar in the 20th century, is a form of yoga that places great emphasis on precision and alignment in each posture. Iyengar Yoga uses props like blocks, straps, and blankets to help practitioners achieve proper form, regardless of their level of flexibility or experience.</p>
                        <p>The primary benefits of Iyengar Yoga include improved posture, enhanced flexibility, and increased balance. Its therapeutic approach makes it particularly suitable for those recovering from injuries or dealing with physical limitations. Each posture is held for a longer duration, allowing for deep muscular engagement and focused breathwork.</p>

                        <p>Ashtanga Yoga, popularized by K. Pattabhi Jois, follows a strict, fast-paced sequence of postures synchronized with breath (vinyasa). The practice consists of six progressively more challenging series of poses that increase in difficulty. Ashtanga builds strength, stamina, and flexibility, and is known for creating internal heat, which purifies the body and mind.</p>
                        <p>This dynamic and physically demanding practice is ideal for those who seek structure and discipline. Regular practitioners of Ashtanga Yoga report enhanced physical endurance, mental clarity, and emotional resilience. The repetitive sequences also allow for deeper exploration of breath and movement over time.</p>

                        <p>Power Yoga, which evolved in the 1990s through the work of Beryl Bender Birch and Bryan Kest, is a more fitness-oriented version of Ashtanga Yoga. This high-intensity style incorporates dynamic movements and poses to build strength and stamina. Unlike traditional Ashtanga, Power Yoga does not follow a fixed sequence of postures, allowing for greater variety.</p>
                        <p>This practice is perfect for individuals looking for a challenging, full-body workout that improves cardiovascular fitness, muscle tone, and endurance. Power Yoga is also effective for weight loss and toning, making it a popular choice in fitness centers and gyms.</p>

                        <p>Aerial Yoga, also known as Anti-Gravity Yoga, combines traditional yoga postures with the use of a suspended hammock. Developed in the early 2000s, Aerial Yoga allows practitioners to explore poses with the support of gravity, enhancing flexibility and strength while reducing strain on the joints.</p>
                        <p>The practice offers the unique benefit of decompression for the spine and allows for deeper stretches in inversions without pressure on the neck or shoulders. Itâ€™s a fun and adventurous way to build core strength, improve posture, and explore new dimensions of movement. Aerial Yoga is suitable for both beginners and advanced practitioners.</p>

The practice is rhythmic, often described as a moving meditation, and offers a blend of strength and flexibility training.</p>
                        <p>With its fluid transitions and varied postures, Vinyasa Flow provides both cardiovascular and strength-building benefits.
